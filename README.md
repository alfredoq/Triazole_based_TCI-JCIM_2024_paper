## Repository description:

In this repository, the source datafiles and Python scripts used as part of the scientific research reported in the manuscript are included.

The corresponding data is organized as part of the following folders:

1-Training_set: this folder containes source _Training_Set.smi_ file including all compounds in included as training set for the molecular docking workflow. Compounds are provided in the SMILES notation within this file. Additionally, this folder contains the corresponding ligands in the .pdbtq format as required by the molecular docking software (AutoDock-GPU)
